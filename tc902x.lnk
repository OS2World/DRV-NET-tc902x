2.No Warranty

This code is provided 'AS IS' and any warranties are disclaimed.


3.Functional restrictions

- Fiber media may not be supported.
- VLAN/Priority function is not supported.
- No recovery from Host Bus(PCI) Error (Master/Target Abort) condition.


4.Note

- I guess that this driver will work on SMP environment. No test.
- PHYsical medium address is searched instead of using always 1. 
   IP1000A uses address 18h.
- IP1000A does not set TxComplete bit of TxStatus register(60.8). 
   Why? FreeBSD driver on IC Pluse website seems to use this bit. 
   The chip used on Asus NX1101 has an errata? bizarre!
- The chips revison >0x0c could check TCP Checksum VALIDLY.


5.Redistribution with modification

Your should add your copyright notice, 
"(c)Copyright 2004 your name. All rights reserved."
and remove mine (if it exists),
"(c)Copyright 2004 chagrin. Some rights reserved."

  (a bug to enlarge rx queue, and another bug found in previous upload 
  code. sorry!!)


7.Acknowledgement

Tamarack sent me TC9021 Datasheet as soon as I requested it.
I could know PHY information from National Semiconductor DP83861 Datasheet.
